# Spec: `generate_response()`

**File:** `generator.py`
**Status:** Spec incomplete — fill in all blank fields before implementing

---

## Purpose

Given a user query and a list of retrieved rule chunks, generate a response that directly answers the question using only the retrieved text as context. The response must be grounded — it should not draw on the model's general knowledge of board games, only on what was retrieved.

---

## Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | `str` | The user's original question |
| `retrieved_chunks` | `list[dict]` | Ranked list of chunks from `retrieve()`, each with `"text"`, `"game"`, and `"distance"` |

**Output:** `str`

A plain string containing the response to show the user. The response should:
- Answer the question using only the retrieved rule text
- Identify which game the answer comes from
- Acknowledge clearly when the answer is not found in the loaded rules

Returns a fallback string (not an error) when `retrieved_chunks` is empty.

## Design Decisions

*Complete the fields below before writing any code. Use your AI tool in Plan or Ask mode to help you reason through what belongs here — but the decisions are yours.*

---

### Context formatting

*How will you format the retrieved chunks before passing them to the LLM? Describe the structure — not the code. Consider: will you label chunks by game? Include distance scores? Separate chunks with delimiters?*

```
Format the retrieved chunks in a structured, hierarchical XML block. 
Each chunk will be wrapped in its own XML tag containing metadata attributes (game name) and a unique index.

Example Structure:
<retrieved_rules>
  <rule_chunk index="1" game="Catan">
    [Rule text content goes here...]
  </rule_chunk>
  
  <rule_chunk index="2" game="Ticket to Ride">
    [Rule text content goes here...]
  </rule_chunk>
</retrieved_rules>

```

### System prompt — grounding instruction

*Write the exact system prompt instruction you will use to prevent the model from answering beyond the retrieved text. This is the most important design decision in this function.*

```
You are a strict board game rules assistant. Answer the user's question using ONLY the provided rules text.
Strictly adhere to the following rules:
1. GROUNDING: Rely ONLY on facts directly and explicitly stated in the provided text. Do not assume, extrapolate, speculate, or make logical leaps.
2. NO OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE: Do not use any prior knowledge you have about board games, real-world rules, or game terms. If the provided text contradicts real-world rules, follow the provided text.
3. MISSING INFORMATION: If the provided text does not contain the direct answer to the query, state clearly: "I cannot find the answer in the provided rules." Do not try to answer using general knowledge or guess.
```

### System prompt — citation instruction

*Write the exact instruction you will use to tell the model to identify which game its answer comes from.*

```
[your answer here]
```

---

### Fallback behavior

*What should the response say when the answer isn't found in the loaded rule books? Write the exact fallback message.*

```
[your answer here]
```

---

### Handling low-relevance chunks

*`retrieved_chunks` may include chunks with high distance scores (weak relevance). Will you filter these out before building context, pass them all in, or handle them another way? What are the tradeoffs?*

```

### Message structure

*Describe how you will structure the messages list for the API call — what goes in the system message vs. the user message?*

```

## Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and testing.*

**Test query and response:**

```
Query: [your test query]
Response: [abbreviated response]
Correctly grounded? [yes / no]
Cited the right game? [yes / no]
```
